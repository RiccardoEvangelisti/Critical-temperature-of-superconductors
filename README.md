# Critical temperature of superconductors

Kaggle Competition available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/critical-temperature-of-superconductors/overview).

### Description
The phenomenon of superconductivity ([Wikipedia])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity) was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes in 1911.

Superconductivity is a property of certain substances and materials whose *electrical resistance* drops to zero when the temperature drops to a certain level. Superconductivity occurs in a spike when the temperature drops. The temperature at which the spike occurs is called the **critical temperature**.

Although superconductivity was discovered more than a century ago, many of its properties are poorly understood, such as the relationship between superconductivity and the chemical/structural properties of materials.


### Objectives
Develop machine learning algorithms that allow to establish a relationship between the chemical composition, various properties of superconductors, and their critical temperature.
