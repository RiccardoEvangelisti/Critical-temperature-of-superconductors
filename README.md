# Critical Temperature of Superconductors

Kaggle Competition available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/critical-temperature-of-superconductors/overview).

### Description
The phenomenon of superconductivity ([Wikipedia])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity) was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes in 1911.

Superconductivity is a property of certain substances and materials whose *electrical resistance* drops to zero when the temperature drops to a certain level. Superconductivity occurs in a spike when the temperature drops. The temperature at which the spike occurs is called the **critical temperature**.

Although superconductivity was discovered more than a century ago, many of its properties are poorly understood, such as the relationship between superconductivity and the chemical/structural properties of materials.


### Objectives
Develop machine learning algorithms that allow to establish a relationship between the chemical composition, various properties of superconductors, and their critical temperature.


### Data
The superconductor data comes from a database of superconducting materials compiled by Japan's National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS).
For each superconductor (each row), the data provides the complete chemical formula of the superconductor, as well as 8 basic chemical properties (absolute value, average, weighted average, and so on): 
- atomic mass
- ionization energy
- atomic radius
- density
- specific heat of melting
- electron affinity energy
- thermal conductivity
- valence
